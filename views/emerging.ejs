	According to the 2020 Emerging Jobs report, the Emerging Jobs analysis is based on all LinkedIn members with a public profile that has
held a full-time position within the U.S. during the past five years. Once the talent pool has
been identified, we then calculate the share of hiring and Compound Annual Growth Rate
for each occupation between 2015 and 2019 to identify the roles with the largest rate of hiring
growth. These become our Emerging Jobs.
